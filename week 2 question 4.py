#For the first task, which was the array of integers being randomly shuffled,
#the Big O notation run-time is O(n). The reason it is O(n) is because the
#in the entire function there is only one loop. So it would have to traverse
#its entire given range before returning a number from the array.

#For the second task, which was the counting the number of trailing 0s in a
#factorial number task, the Big O notation run-time would be O(n^2).
#This is because it contains a loop inside of a loop (nested loop).
#In its worst case it would run N2 or N x N times as the outer loop
#triggers the inner loop.
